# Customer Churn in Banking Sector

## 1. Description
Due to the fact that it is much more expensive to sign in a new client than to keep an existing one, banks have to know what leads clients to leave the company. AI and Machine Learning (ML) can help reduce churn through early intervention. However, building propensity-to-churn models takes time and expertise, and many banks find that not all of their product lines get the attention they deserve because of resource constraints. This lack of bandwidth can often lead to less than optimal customer retention outcomes. The AI & Analytics Engine gives bandwidth back to data teams so that banks maximize the output of their teams to prototype and productionize ML models, so retention strategies can be planned.
